This is the initial commit for a repository of XSD files to define namespace issues for COL efforts.

Note this XSD is fine for defining a schema or XML namespace by which a document could be checked to be valid. 
However, it does not define true "concepts" that could be used in a linked data approach via SPARQL or other 
mechanisms.

To realize that a version in any of RDFS, OWL or SKOS would need to be created to make a vocabulary for use in 
SPARQL or other linked data approaches.  

This XSD is useful to cases such the extensions to the sitemap.xml schema to support WADL documents, for example.
So for a sitemap.xml file like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9" xmlns:col="http://oceanleadership.org/2010/01/sitemapextension/schema.xsd"> 
<url><loc>http://iodp-usio.org/</loc></url>
<col:wadl>
  <col:wadlURI>http://iodp-usio.org/services.wadl</col:wadlURI>
</col:wadl>
</urlset>  

The elements wadl and wadlURI need to be defined in the col.xsd file.
