Information regarding COL and other drilling relation vocabularies:

File index:
* col.xsd
Start of a XSD to collect conceptes related to Ocean Leadership

* sitemap.xml
Example sitemap.xml for LDEO services.  Demonstrates the use of nodes related to WADL as defined in col.xsd for discovery pattern. 
Reference http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mCjnEYxvX8 for screencast on discovery and description process.  

* mesurement.rdf
Original LDEO measurements vocabulary for reference

*ldeoMeasurements.rdf
Slighlty modified version of LDEO measurements vocabulary using small changes in namespaces. 

ldeoServiceMapping.rdf
A test document to map from a resource (like a REST call to LDEO services) to a concept entry in the ldeoMeasurements.rdf file. 
This is only a test and not a production quality representation.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note this XSD is fine for defining a schema or XML namespace by which a document could be checked to be valid. 
However, it does not define true "concepts" that could be used in a linked data approach via SPARQL or other 
mechanisms.

To realize that a version in any of RDFS, OWL or SKOS would need to be created to make a vocabulary for use in 
SPARQL or other linked data approaches.  

This XSD is useful to cases such the extensions to the sitemap.xml schema to support WADL documents, for example.
So for a sitemap.xml file like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9" xmlns:col="http://oceanleadership.org/2010/01/sitemapextension/schema.xsd"> 
<url><loc>http://iodp-usio.org/</loc></url>
<col:wadl>
  <col:wadlURI>http://iodp-usio.org/services.wadl</col:wadlURI>
</col:wadl>
</urlset>  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
* The elements wadl and wadlURI need to be defined in the col.xsd file.  
* Need RDF version of the col.xsd document
* Need to resolve an a best approach to converting to XHTML for publication of the vocabulary.
